# ECR-Lambda
This project is a basic one designed to implement and understand how tools and technology work in AWS.
Once this has been completed, I was thinking about ways in which this can be improved. One of the ways is to use Terraform to implement EC2 instances, configure Lambda services, and ECR as well. Do let me know if there are other ways to do this project.
